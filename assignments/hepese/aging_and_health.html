<p>For the final project, you will analyze data from Wave I of the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/eds/data_search/1798-9301.html">Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE)</a> study. The Hispanic EPESE was a federally funded study in the United States concerned with the health and wellbeing of aging Latino and Hispanic people. Wave I was completed in 1993, and includes respondents from five U.S. states: Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>A selection of variables from the complete dataset to use for your analysis can be downloaded from <a href="https://mcmahanp.github.io/soci620/assignments/hepese/hepese.csv" class="uri">https://mcmahanp.github.io/soci620/assignments/hepese/hepese.csv</a>. A description of the variables included in the selection can be found in the table at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Your analysis should aim to explain the patterns or variation in <strong>one of two</strong> of the included variables:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first option is to try to explain differences in regular utilization of health care among respondents. Why do some older Hispanic and Latino residents visit the doctor very frequently while others do so rarely or not at all? Your primary outcome (dependent) variable for this analysis should be <code>doctor_visit</code>, a count of visits to the doctor over the past 12 months.</li>
<li>The second option is to examine predictors for depression among study respondents. What physical, social, and cultural factors can be used to explain differences in rates of depression among older Hispanics and Latinos? If you choose this option, you should use the variable <code>depression_cesd16</code> as the outcome (dependent) variable in your analyses. (See below for a description of how this variable was constructed.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of which option you choose, your analysis should include a few elements:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, you should utilize a multi-level approach. The data contains the county and state of residence for respondents, as well as county-level population. Your analysis should specifically address variation in patterns across the different counties in the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, you should formally compare at least two reasonable model specifications, arguing why one might prefer one over another.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, you should carefully justify the models you prepare, including the inclusion of covariates, variable interactions, transformations and constructed variables, and overall model structure (outcome distribution, link function, random and fixed effects). Does your model offer evidence of causal relationships between the variables, or is it just descriptive? Have you accounted for confounding, mediation, and moderation?</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis and presentation should make a coherent and convincing argument about the nature of the outcome variable you are trying to explain and the ways it varies across sample respondents.</p>
