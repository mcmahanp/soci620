<h1 id="project-presentations">Project presentations</h1>
<p>In the final week of class (April 9 and 11), each student will present a brief overview of their final project to the rest of the class. In addition helping students clarify the main question and main results from their analysis, it will give the class an opportunity to see the wide variety of creative projects their colleagues are working on.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The presentations will be in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PechaKucha">PechaKucha format</a>. This is a style of group presentation designed to keep talkes focussed and brief, and to allow a number of people to present in a constrained time.</p>
<p>Each presentation will consist of <em>exactly</em> 20 slides, each of which will be displayed for <em>exactly</em> 20 seconds. Each presentation therefore lasts six minutes and forty seconds. While this seems like a very short time to present a complex statistical analysis, it allows presenters to focus on the ‘big picture’ of their project and to leave out the less important details.</p>
<p>Because these presentations are so short, you should feel free to leave out details that you do not think will contribute to conveying your project to your classmates. That said, your presentation will be expected to contain at least the following five components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Title and name:</strong> The <em>first</em> slide (at least) should contain a title for your project and your name. This slide can also contain other content. Including the title and name in a header or footer on each slide is also fine.</li>
<li><strong>Research question(s):</strong> Include a brief motivation for your project and a description of exactly what question or questions you are trying to answer.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical model:</strong> You should show the class the full specification for your model (or for at least one of your models if you use several), outcome distribution, model structure, and priors. You do <em>not</em> need to discuss every component of your model—that could end up taking up your entire allotted time.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> You should show the class the relevant estimated results from your model. You can do this with tables, figures, or a combination. You do <em>not</em> need to talk about the estimates for every parameter in your model, just those that are important for addressing your research question(s).</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Tell us how your model and its results pertain to your research question, whether they help you answer that question, and what you have learned by performing your analysis.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>You will need to send me your slides by 3:00pm the day before you are scheduled to present. I will put all of these together into one presentation to ease the transition between talks. You can give your presentation from your seat or stand behind your seat while you talk.</p>
<p>You can send me your presentation in PDF, Microsoft Powerpoint, or Apple Keynote formats (if this is a problem get in touch and we can figure out an alternate format). What you send me needs to have <em>at most</em> 20 slides. If you have more than 20 I will only include the first 20 in the presentation. If you include fewer (no fewer than 18, please), your talk will end sooner.</p>
<p>One tip: If you want a particular image or slide to stay on the screen longer, you can duplicate slides in your presentation. Just make sure that they show up as separate slides in the file you send to me.</p>
